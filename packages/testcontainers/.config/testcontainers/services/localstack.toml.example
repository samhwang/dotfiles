# Testcontainers Desktop allows you to set fixed ports to easily debug development services.

# This example file defines a default localstack service. For more information, see:
# https://testcontainers.com/modules/localstack/

# To get started, simply rename this file to localstack.toml (or my-localstack-service.toml).
# When at least one container created from the localstack image is running, Testcontainers Desktop dynamically forwards port 4566 to it.
# You can then connect to this container at localhost:4566.

# The `ports` variable defines how to proxy the service's ports:
# `local-port` configures on which port on your machine the service is exposed. System ports (0 to 1023) are not supported.
# `container-port` indicates which port inside the container to proxy. If not set explicitly, the value defaults to `local-port`.
ports = [
  {local-port = 4566, container-port = 4566},
]

# The `selector` variable defines the criteria based on which running containers join the service.
# `selector.image-name` defines an array of image names.
# Containers match the selector if they were created from any image in the array, regardless of version.
selector.image-names = ["localstack/localstack", "localstack/localstack-pro"]

# Sometimes, `selector.image-name` isn't detailed enough. For example, you might be running 2 separate services based on the same image,
# or you might want to target the leader and replicas separately.
# `selector.labels` defines an array of container labels. Containers match the selector if they contain the label. Here's an example:
# [selector.labels]
# "com.testcontainers.desktop.service" = "my-localstack-service"
